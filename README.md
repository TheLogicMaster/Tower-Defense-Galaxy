# Project Status
This project needs to be redone from the ground up. This was the project I used to learn Java and game development in general, so most aspects are very rough.
For a much more advanced LibGDX game, see my current programming puzzle game: [Robot Recharge](https://github.com/TheLogicMaster/robot-recharge)

# TDGalaxy
A 3D tower defense game using libgdx for android and desktop platforms.

This is a modular tower defense game that will allow for the easy addition of themes(Which contain all entity logic and assets)
and levels.
